PROJECT OVERVIEW:

In this project I had to create a doubly linked list complete with unit testing.  The doubly linked list is a very common data structor used in computer science. 


INCLUDED FILES:

 README  this file
common.h   common header file
Job.h   header file for job class
List.h header file for list class
Node.h header file for node class
test.sh   a shell script to run RandomTestList with multiple seeds
List.c the c source code for the doubly linked list
Job.c  the c source code for the job object
Node.c the c source code for the node object
RandomTestList.c the source code for the random test file
SimpleTest.c the source code for the simple test file
UnitTestList.c  unit test source file
Makefile   a make file for building the project.
Doxygen-config,  The config file for doxygen documentation creator

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

To build the all the programs from the directory you have all the files in, just type in 
make

Then to run the files you type in 
./filename of the test file you want to run.



 

PROJECT DESIGN:

This project creates a doubly linked list and many test files to make sure the linked list works correctly.   The list is a very common structure so there was more time spent with the testing than actually creating the list itself. 
 
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING:

The project was started with creating the simple linked list.

As I created each part of the linked list I would create a unit test for that function to run against the 
list to make sure it was working correctly

 
EXTRA CREDIT:
I ran the valgrind tool on this.   This is what took the most time for this project fixing all of the
 memory leaks.  Now with the RandomTestList valgrind shows now leaks. 

SVN

After I fixed (I hope) all of the errors that came back from my professor I added the doublylinkedlist 
to subversion control.  Since added it into subversion I have made a few other fixes to it and submitted
 them and then checked out all the code on my laptop.
